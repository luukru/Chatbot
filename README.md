# Chatbot

## Running our code

We included two folders in this repository. The first is the 'Training' folder, which contains the code we used to generate vocabulary lists and checkpoints from which we can load pretrained models. The second folder, 'CartmanBot', contains all files necessary to run our chatbot. 

To run our chatbot, download the CartmanBot folder and run the file 'telegram.py' with python 3.

## Project

### Datasets
We used two datasets to train our model. The first dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines/data) and contains South Park dialogues from the first 18 seasons. 

The other dataset is the Cornell Movie Dataset, linked in the assignment description. This dataset contains lines and conversations from a large variety of movies, including the South Park movie "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut".

### Results

In the following screenshot, we demonstrate a conversation between ourselves and the CartmanBot.
