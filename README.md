# Chatbot

## Running our code

We included two folders in this repository. The first is the 'Training' folder, which contains the code we used to generate vocabulary lists and checkpoints from which we can load pretrained models. The second folder, 'CartmanBot', contains all files necessary to run our chatbot. 

To run our chatbot, download the CartmanBot folder and run the file 'telegram.py' with python 3.
